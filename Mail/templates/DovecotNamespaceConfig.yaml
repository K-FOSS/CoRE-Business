    ## Mailbox definitions
    ##

    # Each mailbox is specified in a separate mailbox section. The section name
    # specifies the mailbox name. If it has spaces, you can put the name
    # "in quotes". These sections can contain the following mailbox settings:
    #
    # auto:
    #   Indicates whether the mailbox with this name is automatically created
    #   implicitly when it is first accessed. The user can also be automatically
    #   subscribed to the mailbox after creation. The following values are
    #   defined for this setting:
    #
    #     no        - Never created automatically.
    #     create    - Automatically created, but no automatic subscription.
    #     subscribe - Automatically created and subscribed.
    #
    # special_use:
    #   A space-separated list of SPECIAL-USE flags (RFC 6154) to use for the
    #   mailbox. There are no validity checks, so you could specify anything
    #   you want in here, but it's not a good idea to use flags other than the
    #   standard ones specified in the RFC:
    #
    #     \All       - This (virtual) mailbox presents all messages in the
    #                  user's message store.
    #     \Archive   - This mailbox is used to archive messages.
    #     \Drafts    - This mailbox is used to hold draft messages.
    #     \Flagged   - This (virtual) mailbox presents all messages in the
    #                  user's message store marked with the IMAP \Flagged flag.
    #     \Important - This (virtual) mailbox presents all messages in the
    #                  user's message store deemed important to user.
    #     \Junk      - This mailbox is where messages deemed to be junk mail
    #                  are held.
    #     \Sent      - This mailbox is used to hold copies of messages that
    #                  have been sent.
    #     \Trash     - This mailbox is used to hold messages that have been
    #                  deleted.
    #
    # comment:
    #   Defines a default comment or note associated with the mailbox. This
    #   value is accessible through the IMAP METADATA mailbox entries
    #   "/shared/comment" and "/private/comment". Users with sufficient
    #   privileges can override the default value for entries with a custom
    #   value.

    # NOTE: Assumes "namespace inbox" has been defined in 10-mail.conf.

      mailbox Trash {
        auto = subscribe
        special_use = \Trash
      }

      # For \Sent mailboxes there are two widely used names. We'll mark both of
      # them as \Sent. User typically deletes one of them if duplicates are created.
